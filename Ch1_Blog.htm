<h1>Chapter 1 Blog</h1>

<p>Chapter one touches on quite a few tips that I do not think are foreign to us. I think it is interesting however how it is employed in relation to coding. Specifically, thinking big picture is something that seems very familiar to me. The so-called Big picture in reference to coding is interesting because in most situations I feel as though the big picture is often lost or unclear to the programmer. Personally, I find it easy to get hung up on minute details that in the grander scheme may be unimportant. </p>

<p>With this being said, I particularly think the balance of thinking big picture in relation to donâ€™t live with broken windows will be a hard balancing act for me. Being able to identify what would constitute as a broken window versus an acceptable code that may otherwise seem basic will be difficult to distinguish. Further, the broken windows concept was surprisingly obvious after the example of the car was illustrated. Working on an automation team at work, I have seen how the broken window idea does play out in adding code to a previously written script if the script is well documented and written, adding to the code will follow a similar suit, if it is not, the code will continue to reflect sloppy and poor code. </p>
